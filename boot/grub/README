This grub config file will work on microSD cards with one partition (FAT32) for efi (containing the grub.efi binary) and a second partition (ext3) with the rest of the files:
-bzImage --> Linux Kernel
-core.gz --> InitramFS CPIO file (kernel modules built-in)
-/home/tc --> home for tc user (created on first boot)
-/tce/onboot.lst --> list of TCZs to load during boot
-/tce/optional/ --> place to put the onboot TCZs

Console is set to ttyS1 (TTL Serial Port on Galileo Gen2) 115200 8n1.

No swap or compressed swap.

Home is on second partition of the microSD card.

Quiet so the kernel dmesgs do not appear on the serial port.
